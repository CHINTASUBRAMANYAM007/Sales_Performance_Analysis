# Sales Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and visualize sales performance data to gain insights into revenue trends, regional performance, and product-based analysis. The analysis uses Python for data processing and visualization, with key metrics including total sales, profit margins, and product performance.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key trends and insights using plots and charts.
- **Sales Trends Over Time**: Analysis of sales growth, regional trends, and product performance.
- **Revenue and Profit Analysis**: Analysis of total revenue and profit margins.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Optional use of Power BI/Tableau for further data visualization and reporting.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - **Pandas**: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
  - **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
  - **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **Tools**: 
  - **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding environment.
  - **Power BI** / **Tableau** (Optional for interactive dashboards).

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes sales data with the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the sale.
- **Region**: The region where the sale occurred.
- **Product**: The product sold.
- **Sales**: Total sales revenue from the product (in dollars).
- **Profit**: Profit earned from the product sale.
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold.

You can download a sample of the dataset from the `data/` folder in this repository.
